        If you want a soft, juicy, tasty flank steak, you need an excellent marinade like this one. 
        For optimal results, marinate your flank steak for at least two hours, or longer if you have the time. 
        When the steak is sliced and used for fajitas, this fantastic, quick, and simple dish also works wonderfully.
